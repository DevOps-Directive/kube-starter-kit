# The Kubernetes platform you'd build if you had the time

Getting Kubernetes right is hard. Not the "spin up a cluster" part, that's easy. The hard part is everything else: configuring cloud identity and access, bootstrapping GitOps, getting secrets management working, choosing the right ingress controller, setting up observability, and making it all work together without spending months on it.

I've built and maintained Kubernetes platforms at multiple companies. Each time, I found myself solving the same problems, making the same architectural decisions, and wishing I had a solid starting point instead of building from scratch.

**Kube Starter Kit is that starting point.**

It's an opinionated, production-ready platform for **AWS and EKS** that gives you everything you need to run applications on Kubernetes: infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and baseline components, all wired together and ready to go.

## Who This Is For

Kube Starter Kit is built for **engineering teams at early-stage companies** who:

- Are confident Kubernetes is the right choice for their infrastructure
- Want to get to production quickly without cutting corners
- Value having an opinionated path from someone who's done this before
- Would rather customize a working system than build one from scratch

## What to Expect

**You own the infrastructure.** This is your platform running in your AWS account. No managed service dependency, no third-party with access to your environment. Full control, full responsibility.

**Standard tools, no abstraction layer.** Unlike OpenShift, Tanzu, or Portainer, there's no proprietary UI or vendor lock-in. It's standard Kubernetes with standard tools. Your team's existing knowledge transfers directly.

**A starting point you make your own.** Fork the repo and customize it to fit your needs. Future updates to the kit are available to cherry-pick, but you're free to diverge. It's a foundation, not a constraint.
