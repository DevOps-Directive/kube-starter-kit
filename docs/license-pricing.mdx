## License

Kube Starter Kit is **source-available**, not open source. When you purchase a license, you get full access to the codebase to use, modify, and deploy within your organization.

**What the (paid) license allows:**
- Use the kit to build and run infrastructure for your organization
- Modify the code to fit your needs
- Fork and diverge from the original as needed

**What the (paid) license restricts:**
- Reselling or redistributing the kit to others
- Sharing access outside your organization
- Using the kit to build a competing product or service

The license is perpetual; you own the code you purchase and can use it indefinitely.
