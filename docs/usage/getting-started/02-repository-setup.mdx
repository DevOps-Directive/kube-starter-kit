## Overview

Kube Starter Kit is designed to be forked and customized for your organization. This page walks you through the initial repository setup: forking, installing tools, and setting your namespace prefix.

<Note>
Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the [Prerequisites](/usage/getting-started/01-prerequisites) setup.
</Note>

## Fork and Clone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your fork">
    Fork the repository to your GitHub organization:

    1. Navigate to the [Kube Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/DevOps-Directive/kube-starter-kit)
    2. Click **Fork** and select your organization as the owner
    3. Keep the repository name or rename it to match your conventions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone your fork locally">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/kube-starter-kit.git
    cd kube-starter-kit
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install mise">
    The repository uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage tool versions. Install it first:

    ```bash
    curl https://mise.run | sh
    ```

    Then activate mise in your shell (add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for persistence):

    ```bash
    eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"  # or zsh/fish
    ```

    See the [mise installation docs](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for alternative installation methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install development tools">
    With mise installed, install the project's tool dependencies:

    ```bash
    mise install
    ```

    This installs Terramate, Terraform, kubectl, Helm, and other tools at the versions specified in `mise.toml`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set Your Namespace

<Warning>
This "namespace" refers to the naming convention from [Cloud Posse's terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label), **not** a Kubernetes namespace. It's a prefix used to generate consistent, unique names for AWS resources (S3 buckets, IAM roles, etc.) across your infrastructure.
</Warning>

The default namespace is `ksk` ("Kube Starter Kit"). Replace it with your own short identifier (3-5 characters recommended).

Edit `terraform/config.tm.hcl` and change the namespace:

```hcl
globals {
  namespace = "acme"  # Replace with your identifier
  # ... other settings (leave as-is for now)
}
```

<Tip>
After changing the namespace, run `terramate generate` from the `terraform/` directory to propagate changes to generated files.
</Tip>

## Verify Your Setup

```bash
cd terraform
terramate fmt --check
terramate generate
terramate list
```

## Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: configure namespace for organization"
```

## Next Steps

You're now ready to proceed to [Bootstrap Accounts](/usage/getting-started/03-bootstrap-accounts) to set up AWS IAM roles and import GitHub organization members.
