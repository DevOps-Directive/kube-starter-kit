## Overview

Kube Starter Kit is designed to be forked and customized for your organization. This page walks you through the initial repository setup: forking, cloning, and installing development tools.

## Fork and Clone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your fork">
    Fork the repository to your GitHub organization:

    1. Navigate to the [Kube Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/DevOps-Directive/kube-starter-kit)
    2. Click **Fork** and select your organization as the owner
    3. Keep the repository name or rename it to match your conventions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone your fork locally">
    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/<your-repo>.git"
    cd "<your-repo>"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install mise">
    The repository uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage tool versions. Install it first:

    ```bash
    curl https://mise.run | sh
    ```

    Then activate mise in your shell (add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for persistence):

    ```bash
    eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"  # or zsh/fish
    ```

    See the [mise installation docs](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for alternative installation methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install development tools">
    With mise installed, install the project's tool dependencies:

    ```bash
    mise install
    ```

    This installs Terramate, Terraform, kubectl, Helm, and other tools at the versions specified in `mise.toml`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

You're now ready to proceed to [Bootstrap Accounts](/usage/getting-started/03-bootstrap-accounts) to set up AWS IAM roles and import GitHub organization members.
