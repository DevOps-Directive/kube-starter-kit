## Required

### AWS Account

You need an AWS account where the infrastructure will be deployed. The kit uses [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) to manage multiple accounts (infrastructure, staging, production).

<Note>
If your AWS account is brand new, you may need to request a quota increase for AWS Organizations. The default limit is 5 accounts, which may not be sufficient. Request an increase through the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/).
</Note>

### GitHub Organization

A GitHub organization where the repository will live. The CI/CD pipelines use GitHub Actions with OIDC authentication to AWS, and the Terraform GitHub provider manages org-level resources like team memberships.

## Optional

### SigNoz Cloud Account

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) provides observability (traces, metrics, logs). The kit includes pre-configured OpenTelemetry collectors that ship data to SigNoz Cloud.

If you don't set up SigNoz, the observability components simply won't send data anywhere—the rest of the platform works fine without it.

### Terramate Cloud Account

[Terramate Cloud](https://terramate.io/) enhances the Terraform workflow with:
- Drift detection dashboards
- PR preview comments showing planned changes
- Stack health monitoring

The kit works without Terramate Cloud—you just won't get the cloud features. The CLI orchestration still functions locally and in CI.

### Domain Name

A domain name is needed if you want friendly URLs for your services (e.g., `api.staging.example.com`). The kit creates Route53 hosted zones and uses external-dns to automatically manage DNS records.

You can either:
- **Register a new domain** through AWS Route53 or any registrar
- **Use a subdomain** of an existing domain by pointing nameservers to the Route53 hosted zone

If you skip this, services are still accessible via the AWS load balancer URLs—just less readable.

## For Local Development

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required for the local Kubernetes development environment. The kit uses [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes in Docker) to run a multi-node cluster locally.

All other CLI tools (kubectl, helm, terraform, etc.) are managed by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and installed automatically when you run `mise install` in the repository.
