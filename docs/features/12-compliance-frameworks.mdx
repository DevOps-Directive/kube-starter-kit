## Overview

Kube Starter Kit is designed with security and auditability as core principles. While the kit itself doesn't make you SOC2 compliant (that requires organizational policies, procedures, and a formal audit), it provides the technical foundation that addresses many SOC2 Trust Services Criteria.

This page maps Kube Starter Kit features to specific SOC2 controls and explains how they support your compliance posture.

## SOC2 Trust Services Criteria Coverage

SOC2 audits evaluate controls across five Trust Services Criteria. Kube Starter Kit primarily addresses **Security (Common Criteria)** and **Availability**, with supporting capabilities for **Processing Integrity** and **Confidentiality**.

### Security (Common Criteria)

The Security category forms the foundation of SOC2 and is required for all audits.

#### CC6.1 - Logical Access Security

> *The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events.*

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Role-based access control** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | Single `users.yaml` defines AWS SSO users, groups, and permission sets. GitHub teams mirror AWS groups for consistent RBAC. |
| **Centralized identity management** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | AWS IAM Identity Center provides centralized authentication. No long-lived credentials; users authenticate via SSO portal. |
| **Least privilege enforcement** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | Pre-configured permission sets (Admin, PowerUser, ReadOnly) with AWS-managed policies. Easy to add custom permission sets for more granular access. |
| **Network segmentation** | [AWS Architecture](/features/03-aws-architecture) | EKS nodes run in private subnets with no public IPs. Workloads are isolated from direct internet access. |
| **Multi-account isolation** | [AWS Architecture](/features/03-aws-architecture) | Staging and production in separate AWS accounts. Hard boundary prevents cross-environment access or accidental impact. |

**Evidence artifacts:**
- Git history of `users.yaml` changes showing access reviews
- AWS IAM Identity Center user/group listings
- Terraform state showing VPC and subnet configurations

---

#### CC6.2 - Access Provisioning and Deprovisioning

> *Prior to issuing system credentials and granting system access, the entity registers and authorizes new internal and external users.*

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Documented access requests** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | All access changes are pull requests. PR description documents who, what, and why. |
| **Approval workflow** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | Branch protection requires PR approval before merge. Access changes get code review. |
| **Automated provisioning** | [Terraform + Terramate](/features/01-terraform) | Merging approved PRs triggers Terraform apply. No manual AWS console access needed. |
| **Timely deprovisioning** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | Remove user from `users.yaml`, open PR, merge. Access revoked across GitHub and AWS simultaneously. |

**Evidence artifacts:**
- Pull request history showing access change approvals
- Git blame on `users.yaml` showing who approved each change
- Terraform plan outputs showing exact access modifications

---

#### CC6.3 - Access Removal

> *The entity removes access to protected information assets when appropriate.*

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Single source of truth** | [User Management](/features/04-user-management) | One file controls all access. Removing a user entry revokes GitHub org membership, team access, and AWS SSO access. |
| **Audit trail** | [GitOps](/features/05-gitops) | Git history provides immutable record of when access was removed and by whom. |
| **No orphaned access** | [Terraform + Terramate](/features/01-terraform) | Terraform manages state declaratively. Users not in `users.yaml` are removed on apply. |

**Evidence artifacts:**
- Git commits showing user removal
- Terraform destroy plans for removed users
- AWS CloudTrail logs showing SSO user deletion

---

#### CC6.6 - Protection Against Threats Outside System Boundaries

> *The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries.*

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **TLS encryption** | [Kubernetes Baseline](/features/06-k8s-baseline) | cert-manager automatically provisions and renews Let's Encrypt certificates for all ingress endpoints. |

| **Network perimeter controls** | [AWS Architecture](/features/03-aws-architecture) | NLB with security groups controls inbound traffic. Private subnets prevent direct access to nodes. |
| **Container vulnerability scanning** | [Image Scanning](/features/08-image-scanning) | Daily CVE scans against production images. SBOM generation for supply chain visibility. |

**Evidence artifacts:**
- cert-manager Certificate resources showing valid TLS
- CVE scan reports from GitHub Actions
- VPC security group configurations

---

#### CC6.7 - Transmission Encryption

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Encryption in transit** | [Kubernetes Baseline](/features/06-k8s-baseline) | All external traffic terminates TLS at traefik. Internal cluster traffic uses Kubernetes network policies. |
| **Automated certificate management** | [Kubernetes Baseline](/features/06-k8s-baseline) | cert-manager handles certificate lifecycle. No manual certificate handling or risk of expiration. |

**Evidence artifacts:**
- Ingress resources with TLS configuration
- Certificate resources showing renewal history

---

#### CC6.8 - Malicious Software Prevention

> *The entity implements controls to prevent or detect and act on the introduction of unauthorized or malicious software.*

| Control Requirement | Kube Starter Kit Feature | Implementation |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Container image scanning** | [Image Scanning](/features/08-image-scanning) | Grype scans all container images for known CVEs. Reports generated with severity breakdowns. |

## Preparing for Audit

While Kube Starter Kit provides the technical controls, a SOC2 audit also requires:

1. **Policies and Procedures:** Written documentation of your access control policy, change management process, incident response plan, etc.

2. **Evidence Collection:** Regular exports of:
   - Git history for access changes
   - Terraform plan outputs
   - CVE scan reports
   - ArgoCD sync history

3. **Access Reviews:** Periodic review of `users.yaml` to verify access is still appropriate.

4. **Risk Assessments:** Documentation of how you triage and remediate CVE findings.

5. **Training Records:** Evidence that team members understand security procedures.

<Tip>
**Start early:** Begin collecting evidence before your audit period. The Git-based workflow automatically creates an audit trail, but you'll want to establish the rhythm of periodic reviews and documentation.
