# About Me

I'm **Sid Palas**, the creator of Kube Starter Kit and founder of [DevOps Directive](https://devopsdirective.com/about/).

I've helped engineering teams at companies across industries build and scale their infrastructure. Kube Starter Kit distills the knowledge and patterns I've gathered over the past 8 years into a production-ready starting point for your Kubernetes platform.
